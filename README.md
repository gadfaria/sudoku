This is a project for a Sudoku game developed using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). The objective of this project is to provide an interactive implementation of the Sudoku game, with features to generate random Sudoku puzzles and allow users to play.

The Sudoku puzzles are generated using the endpoints provided by sudoku.com. To accomplish this, a server has been created to serve as a proxy.


***To run the project, it is necessary to first start the proxy located inside the "server" folder.***
